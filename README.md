# Portfolio-QA

This is a application of a new and yet not well known metaheuristic optimization method, quantum annealing.
Quantum annealing is inspired by simulated annealing and reviewed from the quantum physics perspective. 
It deals with difficult problems more efficientlythan the classical annealing.
It deals with the portfolio optimization problem.
This adaptation takes financial assets and a given portfolio's expected daily return in order to minimize its risk
(in terms of value at risk). Thus, the efficient frontier (Pareto front) may be drawn.
